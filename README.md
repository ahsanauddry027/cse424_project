## 🧠 Project Description

This project leverages supervised machine learning to \textbf{automatically classify resumes into occupational categories} based on textual content. By vectorizing resume texts using TF-IDF and enriching them with engineered features such as keyword indicators (e.g., ``Python'', ``SQL''), character counts, and formatting patterns, the system captures both semantic and structural signals. Multiple models—including SVM, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and XGBoost—are trained and evaluated to identify the most accurate classifier. The project incorporates K-fold cross-validation for robust generalization and SHAP analysis to interpret model predictions, aligning with the principles of fairness, transparency, and explainability in AI.
